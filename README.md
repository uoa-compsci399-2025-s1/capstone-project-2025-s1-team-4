### Quick configuration before starting the app

1. Install node.js (LTS version):
   
   https://nodejs.org/en
   

2. Install dependencies (in powershell/VSCode terminal) while in project directory

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend React Native app 

   ```
    npx expo start
   ```

4. Install Expo Go on Android, then (making sure your PC and phone are both using the same network) scan the QR code in Expo Go and scan some stuff!

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
